    <li><b>Color Branding</b><br></li>
    Previously, many brands and designers were stuck with web-safe colors.
    More designers are becoming couragous in their approach to color, including supersaturing and vibrant shades combined with headers that are no longer
    just horizontal but re-imagined with slashes and hard angles.

<p id="paragraph-3" class="tech-article-paragraph-3">
<li><b>Serifs on screen</b></li>
    Because of its clean readability, Sans is more favourable in various website 
    interface. Yet, more and more brands are shifting towards bold serifs in their designs.

    <li><b>Black-and-white palettes</b></li>
    Color is what sets the mood when you first visit a blog. It defines a brand 
    and creates visual landmarks in support to guide users through an interface.
</p>
<p id="paragraph-5" class="tech-article-paragraph-5">
<li><b>Outlined type</b></li>
    In a world where chunky sans serifs dominate branding a visually lighter
    letterform certainly does have a different feel.

    <li><b>Mobile first</b></li>
    Mobile users have unquestionably surpassed desktop users in Kenya. Websites that are not mobile responsive, and adapting 
    to various mobile devices across different platforms, will definitely lose out on a good
     number of clients.
</p>
<p id="paragraph-7" class="tech-article-paragraph-7" >
    <li><b>Chatbots evolve</b></li>
    Along with artificial intelligence and machine learning development, chatbots at present are more intelligent 
    and efficient in understanding customer's need.
</p>
<p  id="paragraph-6" class="tech-article-paragraph-6">
    <li><b>Bold Typography</b></li>
    Big and bold typography on homepages make a great impression. This works best
    when the rest of the page is kept minimal and clean.
